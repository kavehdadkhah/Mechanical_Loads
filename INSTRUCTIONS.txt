-Start from the "testcode". Here you can change the different parameters and call
the other functions. For example, you can change the acceleration scenario from
3-1-1 to something else. 

-After running the testcode, you can call the variable you want, like FL. This will
give you the loads at the front-left wheel. Or you can write them to an excel file.
